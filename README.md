# Runique
Runique is a multi-module running tracker app for android devices that also features non-standalone Wear OS app. It is the result of a well-made Philipp Lackner's [Android Essentials Bundle course](https://pl-coding.com/android-essentials-bundle) combined with my additional skills and ideas[^1].
